# Higgs-Boson

Introduction

The study of high-energy physics aims to discover the fundamental properties of the physical universe by investigating the structure of matter and the laws that govern its interactions. Experimental high-energy physicists primarily use modern accelerators, which collide protons and/or antiprotons to create exotic particles that occur only at extremely high-energy densities. The properties of these particles may yield critical insights into the very nature of matter.
One of the main challenges in high-energy physics is to identify rare exotic particles that are produced during collisions at high-energy particle colliders. This problem is typically approached as a signal-versus-background classification problem. Machine learning approaches are often used to solve this classification problem, as finding these rare particles requires distinguishing between the signal (i.e., particles of interest) and the background (i.e., other particles produced during the collision).
In this project, we focus on a binary classification problem in which we aim to distinguish between a signal process where new theoretical Higgs bosons are produced, and a background process with identical decay products but distinct kinematic features. The dataset used in this project consists of 28 features, where the first 21 features are kinematic properties measured by particle detectors in the accelerator, and the last seven features are high-level features derived by physicists to help discriminate between the two classes.
We are interested in using deep learning methods to automate the process of feature engineering and to obviate the need for physicists to manually develop such features. To this end, we will use the provided training dataset, which consists of 600,000 examples, to train a deep learning model to accurately classify the signal and background processes.
In this report, we will describe our approach to solving this classification problem, including our model architecture, training procedure, and evaluation metrics. We will also discuss the performance of our model and provide insights into the classification problem based on our results.

â€¢	Dataset
  The dataset used in this project comprises 600,000 training examples in a CSV file format named "HIGGS train.csv". Each example represents a process, either a signal or background, and is represented by 28 features. The first column contains the class label, where "1" represents the signal process and "0" represents the background process. The remaining 27 columns contain the following features: lepton pT, lepton eta, lepton phi, missing energy magnitude, missing energy phi, jet 1 pt, jet 1 eta, jet 1 phi, jet 1 b-tag, jet 2 pt, jet 2 eta, jet 2 phi, jet 2 b-tag, jet 3 pt, jet 3 eta, jet 3 phi, jet 3 b-tag, jet 4 pt, jet 4 eta, jet 4 phi, jet 4 b-tag, m jj, m jjj, m lv, m jlv, m bb, m wbb, and m wwbb. These features include both low-level features measured by the particle detectors in the accelerator (columns 2-22) and high-level features derived by physicists to aid in discriminating between the two classes (columns 23-28). The testing dataset, which will be used for evaluation, is not provided. For more detailed information about each feature, refer to the original paper.
